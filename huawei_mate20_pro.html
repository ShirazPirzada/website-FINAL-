				You should note that the Huawei Mate 20 would hit the market in two versions, one of them called pro. The normal version will have a panel of 5.9 with full HD resolution. In this powerful version, Huawei would use a screen or something else of six inches with QHD quality. In both cases with a ratio of 18.7: 9, notch will not be missing at the top. The RAM of each of the models would be 4 and 6 GB. It will be Mate 20 to follow the line of P20 and P20 Pro.<br/><br/>

				It incorporates a Full View screen at 1080 x 2160 pixels resolution. P20 Pro would come with a 5.9-inch screen with 2K resolution. It incorporates a microprocessor Kirin 980 and 4 GB / 6 GB of RAM together with 64 GB / 128 GB of internal storage. This is the SoC will really compete with the Snapdragon 845. Evolutionarily, the one corresponds within the product range of the Asian firm. Android 8.0 may be the operating system of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro..<br/><br/>

				

				That in terms of body would be very thin and a profile of weight not more than 180 g. The case is the score Huawei Mate 20 Pro supposedly gets in the synthetic performance test. We are talking about is 356,918 points. That would allow it to surpass all the models on the market including the Samsung Galaxy S9 with a processor Exynos. Apart from the source of the information, the integrated processor will use 7-nanometer manufacturing technology.<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">AUDIO</h1>
				<p class="text">
				The audio quality of the HUAWEI MATE 20 PRO’s speakers are pretty powerful, but they’re no match for the stereo sound from the iPhone XS Max. When playing Portugal. The Man’s “Feel It Still” on Spotify, the P30 PRO Plus got loud but the iPhone delivered more robust bass and richer audio overall.
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">BATTERY AND POWER SHARE TECHNOLOGY</h1>
				<p class="text">
				There’s a 4200mAh battery tucked inside the Huawei Mate 20 Pro. That’s a sizeable cell and even more impressive when you consider just how svelte this device is. As the capacity suggests, this is a champ when it comes to endurance.<br/><br/>

				Many phone manufacturers often tout “two days of use” but the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is one of the few mainstream handsets I’ve reviewed that can genuinely go from 8am on one day and last until midnight the next, and this is without too much fiddling with battery-saver modes.<br/><br/>

				The decent battery optimisation features really help you tailor the phone to work for you. You can alter screen resolution manually, or pick from two preconfigured battery-saver modes. There’s even a Performance mode that will do the opposite, optimising the phone for improved speed at the expense of longevity.<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">PERFORMANCE</h1>
				<p class="text">
					The Huawei MATE P20 Pro has an improved cooling system with a combination of graphene film and a heat pipe with vapor chamber.

					So, the Kirin 980 uses an octa-core CPU design with 2x high-performance Cortex-A76 cores running at 2.6GHz, another 2x Cortex-A76 cores clocked at 1.92GHz, and 4x power-efficient Cortex-A55 cores that go up to 1.8GHz. The processor makes use of ARM's DynamIQ architecture, which is the evolution of big.LITTLE and allows any subset of cores (or all together) to work simultaneously depending on the workload.<br/><br/>

					In our video editing test, which involves transcoding a 4K clip to 1080p and applying a filter in the Adobe Clips app, the Galaxy S10 Plus did just okay. It took the phone 2 minutes and 26 seconds to transcode the video, compared to just 39 seconds for the iPhone XS. The Galaxy S10 Plus did finish faster than other Android phones, though. It is important to note that a new video editing app is coming to the Galaxy S10 Plus soon in Adobe Premiere Rush that’s optimized for the phone.<br/><br/>

					EMUI 9's GPU Turbo 2.0 is supported by six games in total for the time being - PUBG Mobile, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, NBA 2k18, Rules of Survival, Vainglory, and Arena of Valor. It allows all those games to run smoothly and steady at 60 fps at full resolution. Huawei is also working with game developers to enable it in even more popular games though we won't be holding our breath..<br/><br/>	
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">CAMERAS </h1>
				<p class="text">
					The past 12 months have been a strong period for smartphone cameras and Huawei has really done its bit to push forward mobile photography. It’s taken a number of years but the high-profile partnership between the company and German optics brand Leica seems to finally be producing impressive results.<br/><br/>

					Considering its coming shortly after the Huawei P20 Pro, which happens to be one of the best smartphone cameras out there, as well as our Trusted Reviews’ favourite phone of 2018, it should be no surprise that the Mate 20 Pro once again impresses with its photography skills.<br/><br/>

					That ultrawide sensor is the most obvious change from the Huawei P20 Pro, replacing the monochrome sensor Huawei has been using for a while. The reason for this switch is simple: Huawei said there’s enough data and detail captured in the 40-megapixel sensor to make the extra info picked up by the black and white sensor redundant. This seems like a clever move, and it’s one that pays off in practice. Having both a normal focal length, telephoto and ultra-wide sensor offers up a ridiculous level of versatility with your shots.<br/><br/>

					You’ll get the best shots out of the 40-megapixel main sensor. By default, the Mate 20 Pro utilises pixel-binning to use those 40 megapixels to produce a 10-megapixel image. You can shoot purely at 40-megapixels, but this limits the number of features available (you can’t zoom, for example) and leaves you with very large file sizes.<br/><br/>

					Another option on by default is the Master AI system. This makes use of the dual neural engines inside the Kirin 980 to detect scenes and objects, altering the look of the picture in the process. I found this AI boosts colours, adds some minor sharpening to landscapes, and smoothes faces. Nothing is too strong, though, and this mode also builds in HDR.<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">FINGERPRINT SCANNER</h1>
				<p class="text">
					Huawei’s new Mate 20 Pro has a massive screen, three cameras on the back and a fingerprint scanner embedded in the display.<br/><br/>

					The new top-end phone from the Chinese firm aims to secure its place at the top of the market alongside Samsung, having recently beaten Apple to become the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in August.<br/><br/>

					The Mate 20 Pro follows Huawei’s tried and trusted format for its Mate series: a huge 6.39in QHD+ OLED screen, big 4,200mAh battery and powerful new Huawei Kirin 980 processor – Huawei’s first to be produced at 7 nanometres, matching Apple’s latest A12 chip in the 2018 iPhones.<br/><br/>

					The Mate 20 Pro is water resistant to IP68 standards and has a sleek new design reminiscent of Samsung’s S-series phones, with curved glass on the front and back. The back also has an new pattern etched into the glass, which is smooth to the touch but ridged when running your nail over it.<br/><br/>
