				<h1 class="heading"> DISPLAY</h1>
				<p class ="text">
				The Huawei nova 3i comes with a 6.3-inch display, Kirin 710 octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage. On the back there is a dual-camera setup consisting of a 16-megapixel main sensor and a 2-megapixel secondary. On the front there is a beefy 24-megapixel snapper backed up by a 2-megapixel unit.<br/><br/>

				From the back, the Nova 3i looks strikingly similar to the Nova 3e, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. A gorgeous combination of flat, glossy glass and metal makes the handset a pleasure to hold and ogle. <br/><br/>

				Flip it over though, and you'll notice that instead of a 5.8-inch display, the Nova 3i is sporting a gorgeous 6.3-inch screen. While this makes the overall handset a little wider and taller, the impact is lessened thanks to marginally reduced side and top bezels and a chin bezel that's more than halved in width. <br/><br/>

				Smartphones that rely heavily on glass construction almost always run into the same three problems – risk of cracking without a cover, the slippery nature of the glass itself, and its affinity to attract fingerprints. Slapping a case on the phone does hurt the look and feel, but we still recommend it.<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">AUDIO</h1>
				<p class="text">
				Other than the display, the loudspeaker on the Huawei Nova 3i is also unexciting. Not that it’s bad, but it is not the best either.
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">BATTERY AND POWER SHARE TECHNOLOGY</h1>
				<p class="text">
				The Huawei Nova 3i packs a 3340mAh battery which can suffice most users with basic day to day tasks like phone calls, streaming content, music and scrolling through long social media pages periodically.<br/><br/>

				Of course, if you are a smartphone gamer and have a weakness for demanding titles like PUBG Mobile, the one-day battery claim doesn't apply. The GPU Turbo technology does optimize the battery life, but that's not enough to stretch the battery life to one day with 3-4 classic PUBG matches and given that you survive for at least 20 minutes. <br/><br/>

				The charging speed is a little disappointing on the Nova 3i. The Kirin 710 does not offer Huawei's 22.5W SuperCharge and instead, it has 10W charging via micro USB. It takes around 2 hours to charge from 0-100%, which is slow considering what competition has to offer. And with Qualcomm's Quick Charge, a lot of Android users are accustomed to fast charging. <br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">PERFORMANCE</h1>
				<p class="text">
					f we look at the price, it's slightly pricier than the Mi A2 and Honor Play, but still lacks fast charging. Whereas, the other two offer support for fast charging and also have a USB Type-C port.<br/><br/>

					If you are less smartphone dependant throughout a day, even 80% of the battery can sail you through without needing a charger. So, the battery life is quite good, which would have been sweeter if it had fast charge support.<br/><br/>

					Huawei has used AI algorithms that are said to be "driven by learning over 100 million images", which helps it recognizes 22 categories of 500+ scenes and provides optimized shooting result. Now that's still arguable if you want to have AI making your shots better or not. For that, it has an option to turn off the tweaking done by the AI. <br/><br/>

					The HAUWEI NOVA 3I loaded the Asphalt 9 game in 7.95 seconds, compared to 7.08 seconds for the iPhone XS. But the Galaxy S10 was faster to load Mortal Kombat X at 11.3 seconds vs 12.87 seconds for the iPhone.<br/><br/>

					In a nutshell, the camera interface does offer fun features to play with, but I feel it's a bit overdone at places. For example, if the AI is detecting the scene, then why is the Night mode still there. Also, the half-baked 'Background' and 'Effect' modes are just  visually unimpressive. The 'Background' feature sometimes chops-off your ears and at times it just doesn't register your hair. <br/><br/>	
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">CAMERAS </h1>
				<p class="text">
					Just like its predecessor, the Huawei Nova 3i’s claim to fame is its quad-camera setup. There’s a 24-megapixel front camera and a 16-megapixel shooter on the back. Both of them  are partnered with a depth-sensing, 2-megapixel sensor.<br/><br/>

					
					The 16-megapixel primary camera can take good pictures. However, despite the Artificial Intelligence (AI) mode turned off, there are times where the images Huawei Nova 3i captures still feels like it passed through tons of automatic software post-processing.<br/><br/>

					The details feel a little soft and the colors look unnatural. But other than those few instances, it can surely take Instagrammable photos. They look sharp, has vibrant colors, and good contrast.<br/><br/>

					But if you want to utilize the Huawei Nova 3i’s full photography potential, you should enable the AI mode. We’ve initially experienced it in our Mate 10 review, and it works really well. Once it’s switched on, it can instantly detect the scene or subject that you’re shooting. This helps apply the right effect and adjustments in the settings to make it look more professional.<br/><br/>

					On the other hand, the 24-megapixel front camera takes even better pictures, which isn’t surprising since it boasts a more pixel-packed sensor. It has good colors and contrast, although the quality will be put to waste once you use its novelty features.<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">FINGERPRINT SCANNER</h1>
				<p class="text">
					The Huawei Nova 3i might not have the best wireless standards around, but it was still able to cover the basics. There’s the WiFi 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.2 with A2DP. Both of which worked seamlessly during my testing<br/><br/>

					ts connection through our home network was seamless, it can also play music through my wireless headphones and speakers without a hitch. In addition, the Huawei Nova 3i has a built-in FM Radio for those who need it.

					Of course, we also have the 4G LTE connectivity and it works reliably well for as long as you have good signal reception.<br/><br/>
