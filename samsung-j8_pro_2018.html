					<h1 class="heading">DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY</h1>
					<p class="text">
						Generally, I like to combine the design and build quality sections, but this time around, let’s first talk of the design solely, while I promise to get to the build quality in a while. As far as the design goes, the Samsung Galaxy J8 is pretty well designed. The front of the design looks similar to the token design for any device in that price bracket.<br/><br/>

						As for the back, the Galaxy J8 seems like a cheaper variant of the Galaxy S9+, featuring the same dual-camera location followed by the fingerprint scanner below and the LED flash on the right side, all without the glass body. Instead, the body is made up of plastic, which is to be expected, considering the price point.<br/><br/>

						The left side of the device houses the volume rockers followed by the microSD card slot and the Dual-SIM card tray. On the right side, you get the speaker grill followed by the power button. And lastly, on the bottom, we get the microUSB port accompanied by the 3.5mm audio jack. The buttons are well located, and while it isn’t totally meant for one-handed operation, one can still pretty much use the device easily without much hassle.<br/><br/>

						Overall, Samsung’s budget phones have decent build quality and the Galaxy J8 is no exception. Ya, I would have liked a metal or glass design, as is the trend in even budget phones these days but honestly, I am fine with the plastic build of the Galaxy J8. Overall, the Galaxy J8 is a solid phone with decent build quality and that is if you are fine with the plastic design.<br/><br/>
						
					</p>

				<h1 class="heading">DISPLAY</h1>
				<p class="text">
					The Samsung Galaxy J8 packs in a 6-inch HD+ AMOLED display with a resolution of 720 x 1480 pixels and 274 ppi density. Samsung calls it the Infinity Display, but there are a slight amount of bezels, which, to be honest, do take away the praises of the Infinity Display.<br/><br/>

					As for the colors, they do seem nice, albeit a little saturated. Thanks to the AMOLED panel, the blacks are deep, and most things look life-like on the screen. However, despite having a 6-inch display with an 18.5:9 ratio, you’d expect the device to have a good display, right? Sadly, the Samsung J8 comes with a 720p display with just 274 ppi density. It is a Super AMOLED display, but the low pixel count dampens the display.<br/><br/>
					
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">USER INTERFACE</h1>
				<p class="text">
					The Samsung Galaxy J8 comes with the same Experience UI skin that its mid-range and flagship phones come with. There’s Experience UI 9.0 here on top of Android 8.0 Oreo and it packs in a lot of features. There’s Bixby, Face Recognition, which works fine and there are features like themes, game launcher, Samsung Pay mini, Samsung Cloud, games launcher, one handed mode and more.<br/><br/>

					So yes, it’s the Experience UI we know and it’s feature packed but if you like i or not, it’s pretty subjective. I will always prefer stock Android over any skin but if you are okay with the Experience UI, then the Galaxy J8’s user experience will not be a problem for you. Having said that, how does the Snapdragon 450 handle Experience UI?<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">PERFORMANCE</h1>
				<p class="text">
					The inclusion of a Snapdragon 450 processor in the Galaxy J8 is something that surprised me and that’s because most phones with a Snapdrahon 450 are priced below Rs. 10,000 and here, we have the J8 at almost Rs. 19,000. Well, suffice to say, the Snapdragon 450 does not handle the feature packed Experience UI all too well.<br/><br/>

					The custom skin on top of Android is a lot to take for the Snapdragon 450, which is, despite its advancements, still a low-power mobile chip. Moreover, the Samsung Experience 9.0 has a ton of unnecessary and sluggish animations, that make the device look slower than it really is. Yeah, there’s 4GB of RAM on this thing, but with a Snapdragon 450, I hope your expectations from this device aren’t that high.<br/><br/>

					The device proves to be decent enough for everyday use but lags almost everywhere. Normal day-to-day apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook are handled by the device easily. There are stutters in between, and once I even experienced an app crash, but nothing too serious. However, despite having 4GB of RAM, the J8 can’t multitask that seriously, thanks to some aggressive RAM management.<br/><br/>
					
					Also, as far as heavy duty apps and games such as PUBG are concerned, the device cries. By default, the settings are set to the lowest, and despite that, there are lags and stutters during the game.<br/><br/>

					As for benchmarks, it’s a Snapdragon 450, so I didn’t really expect anything great. The Galaxy J8 scored a mere score of 70,791 on Antutu Benchmark and attained a multi-core score of 3,818 on GeekBench.<br/><br/>


				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">CAMERAS</h1>
				<p class="text">
					Budget devices aren’t known to perform that well when it comes to camera performance, but that trend seems to have changed in the past 1 or 1.5 years. Now, devices such as Mi A1, the Redmi Note 5 Pro, Zenfone Max Pro, Honor P20 Lite, and more are offering camera performance which is able to compete with the some of the best in the business. But is the camera on the Samsung Galaxy J8 that good? Let’s find out.<br/><br/>

					The Samsung Galaxy J8 packs in a dual 16 MP (f/1.7, AF) + 5 MP (f/1.9, no AF) camera setup, which, on paper, should do decently. As for the real-life performance, considering the price point, I wasn’t really disappointed.<br/><br/>

					In typical Samsung fashion, the camera on the Galaxy J8 manages to capture images decently but does saturate the colors a lot. As a result, the images turn out to be social media ready, which I’m sure a lot of users will fancy. In proper lighting conditions, the camera is pretty darn good, and there isn’t much to complain about. Even in low-light conditions, the camera fares pretty well, managing to capture images easily.<br/><br/>

					However, the portrait mode is where I absolutely despise the camera performance. Despite having a dedicated depth sensor, the portrait mode is absolutely bad on this device. The edge detection is off the mark, and the blurring feels mostly unnatural.<br/><br/>

					Coming to the front, the Samsung Galaxy J8 sports a 16 MP, f/1.9 sensor along with LED Flash as well. Performance wise, the shots captured are once again good. In fact, this time around, the colors seem to be slightly natural, which is something I always prefer. The portrait mode works well too, but the edge detection is once again an issue. However, the images are slightly soft and there is a lack of overall detail and structure in the image.<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">BATTERY</h1>
				<p class="text">
					The Samsung Galaxy J8 packs in a non-removable 3,500mAh battery, which seems just about right. Thanks to the power efficient Snapdragon 450 onboard along with a Super AMOLED display, I was able to get a decent amount of battery life with the device. Even with heavy use, including gaming, you’ll still end up with at least 30 percent battery by the end of the day.<br/><br/>

					Unfortunately, though, things get bad once you need to top things off. The 5V/1.55A charger included with the Galaxy J8 charges the device slowly, taking an hour to charge to 60% with the device turned off. What’s more is that the device heats up a lot while charging, which is something I personally dislike.<br/><br/>
					
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">SHOULD YOU BUY THIS PHONE?</h1>
				<p class="text">
					At 19K, the Samsung Galaxy J8 is hard to recommend. Sure, the device looks good, packs in decent cameras and has an AMOLED display but the other phones in this price range are simply better. There’s the Redmi Note 5 Pro and ZenFone Max Pro, which bring faster processors, better displays and more premium designs.<br/><br/>

					Well, to conclude things, you can go for the J8 if you want a Samsung phone with an AMOLED display, which by the way is a 720p display, and good cameras but you need to keep in mind that the J8 brings average performance and the design could have been more premium, keeping the price range in mind.<br/><br/>
