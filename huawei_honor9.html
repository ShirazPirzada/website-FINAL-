				<p class ="text">
				The Huawei Honor 9 screen has a 5.15-inch size with resolution 1920 × 1080 px which is equal to Full High Definition (FHD) resolutions of screens. The Aspect ratio of a screen is 16:9. The pixel density is equal to 428 pixels per inch (PPI). Huawei Honor 9 screen based on LTPS IPS LCD technology and able to reproduce 16,777,216 colors with the color of depth – 24 bits. The screen is covered by unknown protection glass.<br/><br/>

				

				

				The display of the Huawei honor 9 is something I was extremely concerned about, and hoping that Huawei would be able to execute correctly. Much of the concern was due to the poor showing of the Mate 20 Pro display which in my review variant was in the form of an LG panel with a MagnaChip DDIC. Mate 20 Pro units with a BOE panel with a Synaptics DDIC reportedly had many fewer issues as well as less power-consumption.<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">AUDIO</h1>
				<p class="text">
				Huawei smartphones are always not good enough in audio performance, and even the flagship models also belong to the middle level, and no one could surpass the lowest versions of iPhone. Maybe Huawei wants to change this condition, so they turn to Hi-Fi. The newly Huawei Honor 9 sports the AKM Hi-Fi chip with enticing advertisement: With innovative ultra-wide 3D sound field technology, you'll be able to enjoy virtual surround sound through your earphones in three different modes. Immerse yourself in music, whenever, wherever. Audio fine-tuning by Grammy Award winner Rainer Mailler. Huawei Histen 3D audio technology brings the experience of live music to the Honor 9. Therefore, we have purchased one model.

				The Honor 9 features a slightly larger battery than the Honor 8, with a 3,200mAh cell upgraded from the 3,000mAh cell on last year’s device.

				Combined with a more power-efficient chipset we found battery life on the Honor 9 to be better than average.<br/><br/>

				el set to normal. If you test Huawei P30 battery life might be you can get some different results. However, we tried to give you the most accurate result that we can provide you.

				<h1 class="heading">PERFORMANCE</h1>
				<p class="text">
					Despite the small increase in the version number, EMUI 9.1 actually brings a major change under the hood - new Huawei phones with this version or later will get a new file system called EROFS, and phones that get updated to this version will get the new file system as well.

					The ERO file system is supposed to offer 3x increase in Random reads and 10% improvement in app startup times. It's also allowed Huawei to reduce the storage taken up by system files by 20%. So, while there are no visible changes from the Mate 20 series EMUI, the P30 should be snappier in certain scenarios and its OS should have a smaller storage footprint than before. Whether we're past the point when you can actually feel the improvement or not is a different matter.<br/><br/>

					In our video editing test, which involves transcoding a 4K clip to 1080p and applying a filter in the Adobe Clips app, the Galaxy S10 Plus did just okay. It took the phone 2 minutes and 26 seconds to transcode the video, compared to just 39 seconds for the iPhone XS. The Galaxy S10 Plus did finish faster than other Android phones, though. It is important to note that a new video editing app is coming to the Galaxy S10 Plus soon in Adobe Premiere Rush that’s optimized for the phone.<br/><br/>

					Other key features of EMUI 9.1 include GPU Turbo 2.0 support and a new Password vault. There is a better Huawei Share too for transferring files to and from a PC and printing documents wirelessly. Other highlights include a travel assistant by HiVision and an in-house developed Digital balance app that tells you how much time you are spending on your phone and gives you the option to set time limits on yourself or your kid (the screen will go monochrome after the allowed usage time is up and most apps will be blocked).<br/><br/>	
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">CAMERAS </h1>
				<p class="text">
					Just like the Huawei P10, the Honor 9 features a dual camera setup, which consists of a 20MP monochrome sensor and a 12MP RGB one, each of these behind its own 27mm-equiv. f/2.2 aperture lens. There is also a dual-tone LED flash.<br/><br/>

					This is the same camera setup we saw on the Huawei P10 and Mate 9, minus the Leica branding. This means you won't be getting the proprietary Vivid and Smooth film modes. Manual monochrome mode is not available just like on previous Honors - it is reserved only for the P series, but this is a silver lining we are happy to live with<br/><br/>

					When you're shooting color, the Honor 9 blends the footage from the monochrome camera with the one from the RGB camera with the goal being, you guessed it, to produce better images. The high-res 20MP monochrome camera records luminance data as reportedly, that's where most of the fine detail is, while the lower-res 12MP camera provides the color to go with the detail. That way you can opt for 20MP color photos, a big leap from the 12MP default resolution.<br/><br/>

					In addition to the Variable Aperture effects, the Honor 9 camera supports Portrait Mode, which combines the Variable Aperture bokeh affect with Beautification, and should offer some nice Portrait shots with bokeh effects. The selfie snapper has been upgraded with f/2.0 lens, and while there isn't a second sensor, Huawei has found a way to create bokeh here as well.<br/><br/>

					Finally, Huawei introduces Live Photos with this new iteration of the Huawei camera app - it's a short 3s video taken shortly before you've hit the shutter, and it plays when you tap and hold on the image - no 3D Touch required.<br/><br/>
				</p>

				<h1 class="heading">FINGERPRINT SCANNER</h1>
				<p class="text">
				 
					Owners of the Honor 8 will remember that the fingerprint sensor was placed on the back of the phone. The Honor 9 integrates the fingerprint sensor into the new physical home button on the front of the phone. As fast and accurate as ever, the new location of the fingerprint sensor leaves the back of the phone clean and consistently level.<br/><br/>

					In 2018, Huawei HONOR 9 global smartphone shipments exceeded 208 million units, and the Huawei’s P20 series shipped more than 17 million units worldwide. While the Huawei Mate 20 series shipped more than 7.5 million units.<br/><br/>
